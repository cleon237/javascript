# 1.1.2 Introduction to Algorithms (120 minutes)

## Designing Algorithms and Writing Pseudocode
Remember the steps of solving an algorithm:

```
Input- There should be 0 or more inputs supplied externally to the algorithm.
Output- There should be atleast 1 output obtained.
Definiteness- Every step of the algorithm should be clear and well defined.
Finiteness- The algorithm should have a finite number of steps.
Correctness- Every step of the algorithm must generate a correct output.
```

On a piece of paper write out the steps to solving each of the problems.

1. Given a list of positive numbers [3, 5, 7, 1, 6], return the largest number in the list.

2. You are trying to get from point B to point C. You can only move one block at a time. The directions you can move are up, down, left right. Write an algorithm to get from point B to point C.

3. 15 people are waiting in line for the store. There are 3 cashiers (Marie, Tomas, and Marco) who are available.
   Marco is new so he helps 1 person out for every 2 people that Marie helps.
   Tomas can only help 3 people maximum before he goes back to restocking the shelves.
   How many people does each cashier help?

### Variables and Primitive types

1. Go to the [repl.it](https://repl.it/@DebbieLy/Variables-and-Primitives).
2. Read the instructions, and match up the correct primitives for each of the variables.
3. Uncomment and do one exercise at a time. 
3. Run when you are ready to check if your answer is correct.
4. You are done when all the tests equal true.

### Taking in user input exercises

1. Construct a program that takes in your name and saves it to a variable.
   At the top of your code, write a comment that has your name and today's date.
   Print out `Hello my name is ` with your name to the console.

2. Construct a program that:
   1. Describe what the program does at the top of the function.
   2. Takes in a celsius temperature.
   3. Converts the temperature from celsius to fahrenheit. 
      The code for the conversion is below:
      ```
      var fahrenheit = celsiusTemp * 9 / 5 + 32;
      ```
   4. Outputs the fahrenheit temperature to the console.

##  Challenge Algorithm Problem
There are 12 people on an island. One person weighs less than the others, 11 people weigh exactly the same. There is a seesaw that can be used to weigh the people. 

1. Design an algorithm to find the person who weighs less.
2. The seesaw can only be used max 4 times, what does your algorithm look like?
3. The seesaw can only be used max 3 times, what does your algorithm look like?

## Extra features
If you're able to implement the steps above with time to spare, check on your pair partner and ask if they need help.
